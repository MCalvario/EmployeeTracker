# EmployeeTracker

## Description
As a fullstack developer, I want to create an application where a business owner/manager will be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees within the company so that he/she can organize and plan the business.

# Usage

To use the application, first start the application.  You will be presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role.  When you choose to view all departments, you will be presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids.  When you choose to view all roles, you will be presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role.  When you choose to view all employees, you will be presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to.  
When you choose to add a department, you will then be prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database.  When you choose to add a role, then you will be prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database.  When you choose to add an employee, you will be prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database.  When you choose to update an employee role, then you will be prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database
